# 2D-anisotropic-structures
This Python code allows to generate 2D disordered ensembles of anisotropic particles. 

The disordered structures are obtained by random sequential addition of hard (non-overlapping) particles until the desired filling fraction, i.e. number of particles, is reached. The particles are added in descending order of size to maximize the velocity of the algorithm.

This code has been used to understand the role of anisotropy in scattering optimisation (see CITATION.txt).
